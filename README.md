# PyTorch_Keras_Experiment

Given a set of numbers, goal of the model is to predict next number in the sequence.

For example, model can be given input like - eight thousand one , eight thousand two , eight thousand three , eight thousand four , eight thousand five , eight thousand six , eight thousand seven , eight thousand eight , eight thousand nine , eight thousand ten , eight thousand eleven , eight thousand twelve....

Model will predict next number given the one input. Model in this notebook predicts next word given any of the words like above (multi steps prediciton). So if 20 numbers are given to the model, it will predict 20 numbers (i.e. a number after each number).
